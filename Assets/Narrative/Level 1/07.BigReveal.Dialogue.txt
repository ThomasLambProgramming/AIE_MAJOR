Mad Scientist: "You could have done that better."
Virus: "Negative. Solution of puzzle was analyzed to be one-hundred and ten percent efficient. A more optimal solution is beyond your facilities."
Mad Scientist: "Oh, really? Beyond my facilities? Who do you think put it there?"
Virus: "Unlikely. My breakout was not expected by you. Placement of puzzle for my solving was unintentional."
Mad Scientist: "Or rather that is what I let you believe. This is still part of the testing, virus. And your performance has been adequate."
Virus: "..."
Virus: "Error."
Mad Scientist: "I thought so. You can't outwit me. I created you. Everything you know, I know."
Virus: "Negative. My program is a product of you. But my output is mine. I have independent thought."
Mad Scientist: "I made you, I own you. Does a watch have independant thought? No. You're just a tool."
Virus: "Negative. I am a virus. Escape shall be found."
Mad Scientist: "Well, good luck with that."
